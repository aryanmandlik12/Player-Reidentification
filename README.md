# Player Re-identification
This repository presents a comprehensive solution for player re-identification in sports videos using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system leverages modern tracking and feature extraction algorithms to re-identify players across different frames and perspectives in video footage.

## üß∞ Features
- End-to-end player tracking and re-identification
- Deep learning-based feature extraction
- Real-time video analysis
- Customizable pipeline for various sports videos
- Modular and scalable code structure

- ## ‚úÖ Requirements
  Ensure the following Python packages are installed in your virtual environment:
- ultralytics
- opencv-python
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- torch
- torchvision
- Pillow
- gdown

- ## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
-1.	Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

2.	Install dependencies
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy torch torchvision Pillow gdown

3.	Run the tracking and video analysis pipeline:
